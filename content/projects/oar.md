**From 2021 to 2023 I have been the main developer of OAR3**. My objective was to improve the code base to make it a direct replacement for OAR2.
My contributions on the project are:

- Developing new features.
- Improving the code base (bug hunting, update libraries, refactoring etc).
- Maintain the continuous integration [pipeline](https://github.com/oar-team/oar3/actions).
- Continue writing and updating the [documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/oar-3/?badge=latest).
- Providing support and assisting users.
