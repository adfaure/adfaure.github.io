[OAR3](https://github.com/oar-team/oar3) is a platform manager and job orchestrator for computing platforms.
OAR3 is a python project developed at Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, and originally written by Olivier Richard and Salem Harrache in 2014.

**From 2021 to 2023 I have been the lead developer of OAR3**. My objective was to improve the code base to make it a direct replacement for [OAR2](https://github.com/oar-team/oar).
My contributions on the project are:

<!-- more -->

- Developing new features, including:
    - Writing a REST API with FastAPI,
    - Updating the CLI with improved visuals,
    - Creating an external plugin system for scheduling,
    - Adding features for dynamic jobs.
- Improving the code base (bug hunting, update libraries, refactoring etc).
- Maintain the continuous integration [pipeline](https://github.com/oar-team/oar3/actions).
- Continue writing and updating the [documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/oar-3/?badge=latest).
- Providing support and assisting users.
